# Plans TODO

## Active
- Execute `v1_draft_build.md` for a local-playable draft.
- Keep scope: local runtime only, no deployment in this phase.

## Decisions Locked
- JS package manager: `npm`.
- Swipe semantics: right = memorized, left = skip.
- CSV import accepts reordered columns by header name.
- Import UI includes textarea paste + file picker upload.
- Fullscreen toggle is deferred.

## Next Phase (After Draft)
- GitHub Pages deployment setup/release.
