# Landing Spec (Core)

## Message
- Bring your CSV.
- Swipe words into memory.

## Implementation Status
The import screen now doubles as the landing page with:
- Hero section: dark slate banner with embedded walkthrough video (`walkthrough.mp4`), auto-play/muted/loop.
- CTA strip: "Try with sample deck" (primary) + "Import my CSV" (secondary, scrolls to form).
- Trust copy: "No account needed. Everything stays in your browser."
- Import form section below the fold with paste textarea, file upload, and "Load sample rows" button.
- Collapsible "Generate a word list with AI" prompt generator.
- Error display groups header vs row errors with actionable messaging.

## Original Scope
- Was optional for v1. Import screen served as the effective landing.
- CTA strip now points directly to import/start flow as planned.
